# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Messages are saved but AI responses don't use the stored conversation history ❌ OBJECTID SERIALIZATION ERRORS: message-memory/stats endpoint returns HTTP 500 errors due to ObjectId serialization issues in FastAPI responses. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The conversation memory system saves messages correctly but the AI models (Claude/Groq) are not receiving or using the full conversation context when generating responses. This defeats the primary purpose of the enhanced memory system.

        -comment: "🍪 GMAIL AUTOMATION TESTING COMPLETED - COOKIE AUTHENTICATION ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Comprehensive testing of Gmail automation for brainlyarpit8649@gmail.com reveals cookie authentication failure: ✅ COOKIE DETECTION: Valid Gmail cookies found (24 cookies) and properly loaded by cookie manager ✅ API ENDPOINTS: All cookie management endpoints working correctly (/api/cookie-sessions, /api/automation/email-check) ❌ GMAIL LOGIN FAILURE: Browser redirected to Google sign-in page (accounts.google.com/v3/signin/accountchooser) instead of staying authenticated on Gmail, indicating cookies are expired/invalid or Google's security measures are blocking automated access ❌ AUTOMATION RESULTS: All Gmail automation tests failed with 'Login failed for gmail - please recapture cookies' message, execution times ~25-26s (within acceptable range but unsuccessful) ❌ CHAT INTERFACE: Gmail automation via chat interface also fails due to underlying authentication issue. ROOT CAUSE: Google's enhanced security measures may be invalidating saved cookies or requiring additional authentication steps. The cookie-based system architecture is sound, but Gmail-specific authentication needs investigation and potentially fresh cookie capture or alternative authentication approach."
